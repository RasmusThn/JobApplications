# JobApplications
I made this Windows Forms app to keep track of all the Job Applications i have sent.
It helps me keep track of the responses i have gotten. 
You can update the rows from 3 different colors. 

Respons but no interview - Red.

Respons with interview - Green.

No Respond - Grey.

Data will be saved in a folder named "Users" in .json format.


Just build release and go to the release folder and run the .exe file. 

Or download folder from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CYxPdkqgM0qeaL6F1tgjq3sNb-TAwm2H/view?usp=sharing
